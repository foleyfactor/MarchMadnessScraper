# MarchMadnessScraper
Scrape peoples' picks out of their ESPN brackets and do some fun analytics on them to see who did what for March Madness.

## Inspiration
A group of friends who know nothing about college basketball (well, most of us) always play the March Madness bracket challenge. One of our players thought it would be cool to get some more stats on how many upsets people picked and whatnot, and I like writing python scripts so I made this.
